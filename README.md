# Hockeysite
This is a project I will be working on my free time to practice, showcase, and further develop my data science, data visualization and R skills. [The website can be found here](https://mfitzgerald.shinyapps.io/hockeysite/). Below is a brief description of what is actually being displayed on the webpage and briefly what packages were used and how everything interacts and below that is a to-do list for myself of what I would like to work on next.

### Description of the Website

The scatter plot is primary points per 60 (P1/60) plotted against their Corsi For percentage (CF%) for 579 NHL skaters with at least 500 minutes at 5v5. The size of the bubbles corresponds to the amount time on the ice and the color corresponds to the player's position. When you hover over a dot the players name, picture, total goals/assists/points/shots/toi/cf%, a barchart of the high danger (HD), medium danger (MD), and low danger (LD) corsi events and a pie chart with what percentage of their points are goals, primary assists and secondary assists. The blue line on the barchart represents 50% as the plot shifts from player to player (I will most likely change this to a fixed axis so it is easier to compare player to player but the blue horizontal line hopefully anchors this some in the meantime). 

### To-Do List
+ Fix issues with thumbnail images not displaying when a player is hovered over
+ Simplify positions to LW, RW, C, and D
+ Add filters to filter by team and position
+ Add filters to filer by time on ice (TOI)
+ Make the layout of the webpage a bit sleeker (this will likely need to be broken down into more specific tasks)
+ Build another tab for a Fantasy Hockey scheduler
